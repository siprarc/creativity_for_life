		<p>I always want my brushes to be full of paints and my mind full of imaginations. Sometimes it seems to me that life is formless and blurry, especially when I lose my focus amidst the chaotic busyness of life. Art is one thing that has given me satisfaction - it is like meditation and nourishment of mind. Art allows me to discover and preserve my delighted mind.</p>
