	Food and creativity are closely intertwined. Cooking is not only a necessity for sustenance, but it can also be a form of art that allows individuals to express themselves in a unique and personal way.

	Food can be used as a canvas for creativity. Cooks use ingredients, flavors, textures, and presentation to create their dishes that are not only delicious but also visually appealing. The experimentation with different combinations of ingredients, techniques, and cooking methods to create new and innovative dishes helps in pushing the boundaries of traditional cuisine.
	Creativity is essential in food photography, food styling, and food journalism. Food photographers and stylists use their artistic skills to create visually stunning images of food that evoke emotions and tell stories. Food journalists use their creativity to write engaging and informative articles about food and food-related topics.

	For me, in addition to being a form of art, cooking is a therapeutic activity that promotes mindfulness and well-being. Preparing a meal for myself or others provides solace which has helped me to reduce stress and improve my mental health.
	
	Overall, food and creativity go hand in hand. Whether it's through cooking, photography, writing, or any other food-related activity, individuals can express their creativity and connect with others through the universal language of food.

	I love food (YUM!!!) ….When I think or read about food, it doesn't matter where it is from, I can see a smile on my face. Food is one thing in the world that brings people together. People just feel closer to people who are eating the same food as they do. And then this builds trust, cooperation, which are just consequences of feeling close to someone. It also helps people to connect to their cultural or ethnic group. It is often used as a means of retaining one's cultural and ethnic identity. Although people from different cultural backgrounds eat different foods, it is this food that brings people together. The sharing of food has brought people together since the beginning of time. It’s how we make friends, nurture relationships, celebrate milestones, mend differences and feel gratitude for life.
