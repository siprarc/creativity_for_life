    Growing up in the eastern state of India named Odisha, I was immersed 
    in Odiya food, culture and architecture. I was born and raised in Bhubaneswar, 
    the capital city. The tri-city: Bhubaneswar, Puri and Cuttack was the epicenter 
    of rich Odia culture and architecture. Bhubaneswar is also known as the 
    city of temples; anchors a rich cultural heritage with sculpture, art, 
    applique, food and my favorite - the beautiful Odissi dance. My architect 
    father nourished in me a passion for all of these. Like every middle class 
    family in small town Bhubaneswar, academics and professional career took priority 
    but I snuck in time for an occasional art work or cooking something uniquely 
    'Odia swada' for my family. As far as non-academic pursuits, I spent time 
    getting trained for track and field by dad or reading books, or learning 
    Indian classical music, or filling in all the canvases and paper with my 
    sketches and paintings, or gardening with my grandparents. 
    Although, I loved Odissi dance and aspired to be a 
    young artist once, I was discouraged to learn this art form. 
    As a teenager, my fascination with plants and flowers was more than just a hobby—
    it was a connection to nature, curiosity, and cherished time spent with my grandmother.
    Our garden was a world of its own, a space where I learned to appreciate the delicate 
    beauty of a blooming flower and the patience required to nurture life from the soil.
    Every afternoon, I would join my grandparents in the garden, where they shared their 
    wisdom about different plants, their needs, and the magic of watching them grow. 
    She taught me how to gently care for roses, water the tomatoes just right, and 
    understand the seasons’ impact on our little green haven. Digging into the earth,
    planting seeds, and waiting for them to sprout filled me with a sense of wonder 
    and accomplishment. Beyond the technical aspects of gardening, those moments became a source of peace 
    and reflection. The scent of fresh soil, the vibrant hues of petals, and the quiet 
    companionship with my grandparents made gardening more than just a pastime—it was an 
    experience that shaped my appreciation for nature’s beauty and resilience. 
    Even today, whenever I see a flourishing plant or inhale the fragrance of blooming flowers,
    I am reminded of those special days spent with my grandmother, where my love for gardening and plants
    truly blossomed.
    Not to mention, I am also a true foodie with talent for cooking and baking, turning simple 
    ingredients into extraordinary culinary creations. My passion for flavors, textures,
    and presentation shines through in every dish I try to make, whether it's a comforting 
    homemade meal or an intricate pastry masterpiece. Cooking isn't just a skill for me — 
    it's an art, a way to express creativity and bring joy to others through food. 
    My ability to experiment with flavors, perfect recipes, and craft delicious treats 
    makes every meal an experience worth savoring. I keep embracing this gift and 
    sharing my love for food with my friends and family!

    Coming to America, getting myself settled and raising a family took much of my attention but now 
    as my daughter heads off to college, I can finally indulge in all 
    my passions and my dreams. So, I decided to create my blog or a web 
    page "<span class= "tag-line">#Creativity for Life#</span>". 
    Through this blog, I would like to continue my journey and stay connected 
    with my friends, family and like-minded people. I would like all of you to 
    join me in this journey; and celebrate anything and everything that makes 
    life so amazing and beautiful.
