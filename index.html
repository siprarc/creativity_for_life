		I was born and brought up in a middle class, conservative family in Bhubaneswar, capital of Odisha state, India. At an early age, I always tried to be creative, making something or other from recycle materials. My exposure to fine arts was through my dad, who was an Architect.  My home state Odisha (formerly known as Orissa), an eastern Indian state on the coast of the Bay of Bengal is known for its rich art, cultures, heritage and of course its ancient temples. Bhubaneswar is itself home to hundreds of temples and is surrounded by places with deep roots to local art forms - Odissi dance, stone carving of beautiful dancers, applique work and tribal paintings. All these have left a strong imprint in my mind and interest in art and crwativity. 

		Although the competitive secondary education system in India and professional career here in America somewhat put my creativity on the back burner, I had never completely closed that chapter of my life. Every now and then, while still working my 8-6 job and managing my kids, I would still try to find time to revisit my passion either by doing art work, or cooking with my husband or daughter, or learning/choreographing dance pieces. So, finally I decided to plung on my creavity angle and build out my blog/web page <span class="tag-line"> “# Creativity for life#”</span>. Through this blog, I would like to continue to inspire my friends and family to join me in this journey; and celebrate anything and everything that makes life so amazing and beautiful.</p>
