		Growing up in an Indian middle class family in the capital city, Bhubaneswar, I had quite a bit of exposure to local art and culture. My home state, Odisha (formerly known as Orissa), is a state on the east coast of the Bay of Bengal. It is known for its rich art, cultures, heritage and of course its ancient temples. Bhubaneswar is home to hundreds of temples and is surrounded by places with deep roots to local art forms - Odissi dance, stone carving of beautiful dancers, applique work, and tribal paintings among other things. My dad being an Architect helped me to build on some of these exposure into my passion.  All these have left a strong imprint in my mind and interest in art. 

		As a little girl, I kept myself busy building on my creativity skills along with my sports and academics. Although the competitive secondary education system in India and professional career here in America somewhat put my creativity on the back burner, I had never completely closed that chapter of my life. Every now and then, while still working my 8-6 job and managing my kids, I would still try to find time to revisit my passion either by working on an art piece, or cooking with my husband and kids, or learning/choreographing dance pieces with my daughter. I never really felt out of touch with my creativity. 

		So, finally I decided to create my blog/web page "<span class= "tag-line"># Creativity for Life #</span>". Through this blog, I would like to continue my journey and stay connected with my friends and family. I would like all of you to join me in this journey; and celebrate anything and everything that makes life so amazing and beautiful.
