		Growing up in the eastern state of India, Odisha, I was immersed in Odiya culture. I was born and raised in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha. The tri city - Bhubaneswar, Puri and Cuttack was the epicenter of rich Odia culture. Bhubaneswar is also known as the city of temples; anchors a rich cultural heritage with sculpture, art, applique, food and my favorite - the beautiful Odissi dance. My architect father nourished in me a passion for all of these. Like every middle class family in small town Bhubaneswar, academics and professional career took priority but I snuck in time for an occasional art work or cooking something uniquely 'Odia swada' for my family. As far as non-academic pursuits, I spent time getting trained for track and field, or reading books, or learning Indian classical music, or filling in all the canvases and paper with my sketches and paintings.

		Coming to America and raising a family took much of my attention but now as my daughter heads off to college, I can finally indulge in all my passions and my dream. So, I decided to create my blog or a web page "<span class= "tag-line">#Creativity for Life#</span>". Through this blog, I would like to continue my journey and stay connected with my friends, family and like-minded people. I would like all of you to join me in this journey; and celebrate anything and everything that makes life so amazing and beautiful.
