		<p>Photographs capture a moment that’s gone forever, impossible to reproduce 
			but we can time travel with those. As a little girl, I always had a thirst 
			to see the world, and to capture it all on camera. I felt that I could hold 
			an instant of time, of emotion, a memory, right in my hands. I never really 
			took any of the pictures when I was a kid, but I sure did appreciate the 
			pictures in my mom’s old albums.I would spend time flipping through those 
			photo albums that my parents made, looking at them, rearranging them and 
			remembering the moment that they were taken. But I took away many life 
			lessons - gratitude, mindfulness, connection and giving. Life is about 
			the heart. You may know every technical detail about your camera or about 
			photograph….that doesn’t matter that you will take a good photograph. It 
			needs to have heart. It was many years later, my husband bought me a 
			Nikon powershot and I would shoot everything and anything - some were 
			blurry and out of focus. But it didn’t matter because I loved it. 
			My interest turned into a hobby and I started to crave better and better 
			equipment that could increase my ability and even took a class. I upgraded 
			from the Nikon Powershot to the D2700. What I took away from this 
			journey is “A good photograph is one that communicates a fact, touches 
			the heart and leaves the viewer a changed person for having seen it. 
			It is, in a word, effective.”— Irving Penn
