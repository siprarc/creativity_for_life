	<p>"Odissi is not a mere dance form to entertain people but to inspire and elevate. I don't actually dance but pray in compassion and the spectators say that this `form' is dancing. - Kelucharan Mohapatra"
    As a kid, I was always interested to learn Indian classical dance (any form). However, I didn't get a chance to explore my passion as I grew up in a very conservative middle class family.........

<h4>Mangalacharan - Ganesh Vandana </h4>
<p>This marks the entrance of the dancer on stage in the Odissi style. The dancer invokes the blessings of Lord Jagannath for an auspicious beginning. Then the dancer offers salutation to the Mother Earth, the Teacher, and the Accompanist and to the Audience. Then follows a prayer to Lord Ganesh, remover of all obstacles.</p>
