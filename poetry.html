		<h1>Poetry</h1>
		<p>Poetry is the art of painting feelings with the stokes of words, creating a masterpiece of emotion on the canvas of the soul.</p>

		<p>I write poems to capture the toughts of my mind and whispers of my soul - painiting emotions with words and rhythms of verses, finding a santuary where my thoughts can dance freely.</p>
