	<h1>Poetry</h1>
	<p>Poetry is the art of painting feelings with the stokes of words, 
		creating a masterpiece of emotion on the canvas of the soul.</p>

	<p>
		I write poems to capture the toughts of my mind and whispers of my soul 
		- painiting emotions with words and rhythms of verses, finding a santuary 
		where my thoughts can dance freely. It serves as a unique form of 
		experiencea and perspectives with depth and beauty. It enhances 
		communication, fosters empathy and provides a mean to explore and 
		understand the complexities of life. Through its lyrical nature, 
		poetry has given me the power to inspire, provoke thought and connect 
		with people on a profound level.
